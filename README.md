# 2048
 
 2048 is a popular puzzle game played on a 4x4 board in which the objective is to reach the 2048 tile.
 
 Players should use the up/down/left/right arrows to shift the board in that direction to combine like-numbered tiles. If the board is full and there are no valid moves left the player loses.
